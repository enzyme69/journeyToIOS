Not long ago, I found that programming is a very daunting task. And making an app is very much impossible.

However, I learn that I can learn little bit of programmings here and there. I enjoy experimentings on things, change attribute and try again. And I started to enjoy the act of writing codes.

I am self taught in programming. I have in the past tried learning using:
* Processing
* Scratch
* ChucK
* Blender BPY
* Swift

Over the course of actually "learning" programming concept, knowing how to adapt to language, and to actually make something useful like a function or NODE, I got a lot of help from few people.

Zeffii aka Dealga has been very helpful, via his Blender Scripting website and also how he guides me to understand programming better via Sverchok Add-On.
